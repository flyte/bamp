# Introduction

### Hello!

Thank you for considering contributing to Bamp. You are very welcomed to help fixing bugs, 
merging pull requests, writing docs, suggesting improvements or filing bug reports.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

If you never contributed to open source please have a look at these *free* tutorials:

# Getting started
### How to submit a contribution.

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Write unit tests, and if required interface tests
    * Check your code against [pycodestyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle) and/or [pylint](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pylint)

# How to report a bug
Please raise issues on [github](https://github.com/inirudebwoy/bamp/issues), but first search if the issue hasn't been raised yet. 
When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
1. What version of Python are you using (go version)?
2. What operating system are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

### Suggesting a feature.
[Open an issue](https://github.com/inirudebwoy/bamp/issues/new) on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Code, commit message.

### Preferred code style.

You won't be surprised if I write here that [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is followed in this project. I already mentioned earlier that it would be useful to run [pycodestyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle) against your code. 

### Commit message conventions.

Short summary of changes (50 chars or less). If it's necessary please include more detailed explanation. Keep the length line around 72 chars.
